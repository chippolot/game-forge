## Game Name: 
Grid Lock

## Description:
Grid Lock is a two-player strategic game played on a simple grid. Players take turns placing their pieces on the grid and trying to block their opponent's movements.

## Setup:
The game is played on a 5x5 grid, initially empty.
Each player has three pieces of their own color, represented by different symbols or colors.
Players decide who goes first.

## Gameplay:
Players take turns placing one of their pieces on any empty cell of the grid.
Once all pieces are placed, players take turns moving one of their pieces to an adjacent empty cell (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally).
Pieces cannot move through or onto cells occupied by another piece.
The objective is to strategically position your pieces to block your opponent's movements while finding opportunities to advance your own pieces.

## Strategy:
Blocking: Players can strategically position their pieces to block their opponent's movements and restrict their options.
Mobility: Maintaining mobility is crucial, as players need to maneuver their pieces to reach advantageous positions.
Sacrifice: Sacrificing a piece to gain a better position or block an opponent's movement can be a strategic move.

## Winning:
The game ends when one player successfully blocks all of their opponent's pieces, rendering them unable to make a legal move.
The player who accomplishes this wins the game.
